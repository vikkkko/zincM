# Literals

Simple literal operands are the basic elements of an expression:

- `42` - integer
- `false` - boolean
- `"error"` - string
- `u128` - type (in casting clauses like `42 as u128`)

There are several complex operands worth mentioning. As you will see from the
examples, you can nest these constructions as deep as you need, but do not abuse
this ability too much.

> Integer literal can be written with the pseudo-fractional part, which is useful
> for representing values with a lot of zeros after the comma, e.g. WEI units or
> satoshis: `1.0_E18`, `0.001_E8`, `42_E6`.

> Such numbers are pseudo-fractional, as the exponent cannot be less than the number
>of fractional digits.

## Array

```rust,no_run,noplaypen
let array = [
    1,
    2,
    3,
    4,
    5,
    1 + 5,
    { let t = 5; t * t },
];
```

The inner type and array length are inferred by the compiler.

## Tuple

```rust,no_run,noplaypen
let tuple = (42, true, [1, 2, 3]);
```

The inner types and the tuple type are inferred by the compiler.

## Structure

```rust,no_run,noplaypen
struct Data {
    value: field,
}

fn main() {
    let data = Data {
        value: 0,
    };
}
```
