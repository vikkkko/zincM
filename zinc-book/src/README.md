# Intro

Zinc is a programming language which can be used to develop:

1) Smart contracts for [zkSync](https://zksync.io) (a ZK Rollup on Ethereum).
2) General-purpose zero-knowledge proof circuits.

Existing ZKP frameworks lack functionality specific for smart contracts.
Security and safety aspects are crucial for developing smart contracts since they
deal with valuable financial assets. Modern smart contract languages, such as
Simplicity or Libra's Move, deliberately made design choices that favor safety
and formal verifiability of the code over generalistic expressiveness.

Zinc is created to fill the gap between the two worlds: to provide a smart
contract language optimized for ZKP circuits, which is reliable and simple at the
same time, and can be quickly learned by a large number of software developers.

We decided to borrow the Rust syntax and semantics. Zinc is a subset of Rust
with minor differences dictated by the subtleties of ZKP circuits. It is easily
learnable by any developer familiar with Rust, Golang, C++ or other C-like
languages. Also, experience with Solidity will help in understanding some smart
contract specifics.

The language is under heavy development, thus many of its aspects will eventually
be improved or changed. However, the basic principles, such as security and
simplicity, will never be questioned.
