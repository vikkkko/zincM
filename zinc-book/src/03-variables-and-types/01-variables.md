# Variables

As it was said before, Zinc is mostly about safety and security. Thus,
variables are immutable by default. If you are going to change their values,
you must explicitly mark them as mutable. It protects your data from accidental
mutating where the compiler is unable to check your intentions.

```rust,no_run,noplaypen
fn test() {
    let x = 0;    
    x = 42; // compile error: mutating an immutable variable

    let mut y = 0;
    y = 42; // ok
}
```

Immutable variables are similar to constants. Like with constants, you cannot
change the immutable variable value. However, constants cannot infer their type
and you must specify it explicitly.

```rust,no_run,noplaypen
const VALUE: field = 0;

fn test() {
    let variable = VALUE;
}
```

Variable shadowing can be a convenient feature, but Zinc is going to enforce
warning-as-error development workflow, forbidding variable shadowing as a
potentially unsafe trick. You should use mutable variables or type suffixes
if you need several adjacent variables with similar logical meaning.

```rust,no_run,noplaypen
fn test() {
    let mut x = 5;
    {        
        let x = 25; // compile error: redeclared variable 'x'
    };    
    let x = 25; // compile error: redeclared variable 'x'

    x = 25; // ok
}
```

### Tuple destructuring

It is possible to declare multiple variables with a single `let` statement:

```rust,no_run,noplaypen
fn main() {
    let (mut a, b) = (42, 25);

    let (c, (mut d, e)) = (42, (25, 16));
}
```

> This feature is identical to that of Rust, but it is only supported for the
> `let` statement. Function arguments cannot be destructured.
